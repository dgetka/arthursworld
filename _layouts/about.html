<center>This collection of early 20th century postcards is intended to reflect the world as one person saw it: Lieutenant Arthur Theodore Johnson (1896-1918). Born and raised in northern Indiana, Johnson spent his childhood and adolescence moving between towns that just about grazed the Lake Michigan shoreline.</center>
