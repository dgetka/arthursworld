## About the Collection

This collection of early 20th century postcards is intended to reflect the world as one person saw it: Lieutenant Arthur Theodore Johnson (1896-1918). Johnson was born and raised in northern Indiana, spending his childhood and adolescence moving between towns along the Lake Michigan shoreline.

This site is generated using [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), a project to create a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from: 

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPG images or PDF documents

The template repository features four objects from the University of Idaho Library's [Digital Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital).
